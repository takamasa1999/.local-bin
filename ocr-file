# This script takes a file path as an input argument,
# generates an output file path by removing the extension,
# and then runs tesseract to create a searchable PDF.

# --- 1. Input Validation ---
# Check if an argument was provided. If not, print usage info and exit.
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "Error: No input file specified."
    echo "Usage: $(basename $0) <path_to_image_file>"
    exit 1
fi

# --- 2. Path Preparation ---
# Get the full, absolute path of the input file.
# In Zsh, the ":a" modifier on a parameter expansion resolves it to an absolute path.
input_file_path="${1:a}"

# Check if the resolved file path actually exists and is a regular file.
if [[ ! -f "$input_file_path" ]]; then
    echo "Error: File not found at '$input_file_path'"
    exit 1
fi

# Prepare the base for the output file path by removing the file extension.
# In Zsh, the ":r" modifier gives the "root" of the filename (removes extension).
output_dir_base="${input_file_path:r}_OCR"


# --- 3. Command Execution ---
# Display the paths that will be used to the user for confirmation.

# Tesseract will automatically append the ".pdf" extension to the output file.
